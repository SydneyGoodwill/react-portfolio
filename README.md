  ## Installation
  This application was built using React. In order to create a React App, you must first run this command from your terminal "npx create-react-app ..." (substitute the 3 dots for the title of your React application). Your React App will then be built from whatever directory you are in, when you run that command.

  ## Usage
  My application is meant to show off some of my development work, so a user can simply browse its pages as they would for other websites. The About/Home page offers a little bit of information about me, the Portfolio page showcases my work, and the Contact page lists my contact information.

  ## Test
  The instant nature of React made testing this application very managable. If something isn't right, the application simply won't run and you will be given errors.
